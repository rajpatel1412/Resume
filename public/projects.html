                <h3>Drive-through Automated Order Taker</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Designed an automated pipeline to receive orders, 
                        process them using customized LLM techniques, and 
                        input them into the system, eliminating the need for 
                        dedicated human order-taker and lowering order-taking 
                        time by 24 seconds.

                        <p>
                        Utilized advanced AI models and techniques to create
                        a pleasant experience for customers, improving 
                        customer satisfaction in-store by 21%.

                <h3>Bark Buddy | Affective Computing Pet Simulator</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Designed a 3D pet dog using Unity, python and affective 
                        machine learning models (object detection, facial 
                        expression inference, audio capture, denoising, tone 
                        inference and semantic analysis) to target loneliness 
                        in old age, resulting in a 60% adoption rate in a 
                        conducted survey. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Produced an API between the Python interpreter and Unity 
                        to allow communication of inference data and captured 
                        signals, reducing latency by 23%. 
                        </p>

                <h3>Sign-ifier | Embedded Software Project</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Spearheaded an Agile team of 3 members to produce an 
                        embedded Raspberry Pi/Beagle Bone system that captures 
                        video of ASL signs, infers the sign using a machine 
                        learning model, and outputs the result to a local 
                        server-powered website, resulting in a 76% forecasted 
                        first-year adoption rate. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Implemented multiple socket communication protocols to 
                        bridge the gap between different embedded devices (camera, 
                        screen, Beagle Bone/Raspberry Pi), resulting in a 14% 
                        decrease in latency.
