        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Outgoing, innovative and thoughtful, my dream is to impact the world and change it for the better. 
            Given my upbringing in multiple different places including Kenya, India and Canada, I have a fresh and 
            multidimensional perspective on the world and its problems as well as the tools to try and solve them, 
            sharpened by the impeccable Computer Science education I received at SFU.
        </p>
        <p>Adept at programming in multiple modern languages including, but not limited to C/C++, Python, C#, R, and 
            React amongst others. I also possess skills in other programming tools such as MATLAB, Android Studio, Unity, 
            Unreal and Linux amongst others. Multiple internships, volunteer opportunities, and part-time jobs have honed 
            my teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and pressure-handling skills. I love archery, hiking, and writing, 
            and I am willing to take on any challenge presented to me. My recent academic and personal projects can be
